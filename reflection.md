Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
The warm-up exercise helps me understand how to do mirrorwords and I realized later that the comparison exercise (string.equal) realy matters in this assignment! So the warm-up is really helpful!
Sometimes it is really useful to write out the comments to not confuse myself.
However, I don't know if there're easier ways to examine the mirrored conditions and store the transcripts.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I didn't consult with classmates but indeed kinda work with them together in the TA hours.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
TA session on Thursday's night with Jessica and Bobi :)

- What are your initial impressions of Java?
It is pretty similar to C++.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
Python is more straightforward.
Up to now, I feel that java needs to remember more default steps. (Also, this assignment made me realize that when you make changes like string.replace(), you have to do string = string.replace(), I'm not pretty sure if it is the case with python..)

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the program can output simple mirror messages but could not handle with more complex syntax. For example, I set the program to not mirror the punctuations when Am or Are is in the front of the sentence. However, I feel it really hard to deal with the 'Do I/you ...?' situation.
Check out on the java documentation (or google) for more methods!
