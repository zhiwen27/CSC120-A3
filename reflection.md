Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
The warm-up exercise helps me understand how to do mirrorwords. Sometimes it is really useful to write out information needed to be mirrored. I don't know if there're easier ways to examine the mirrored conditions and store the transcripts.
- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
TA session on Thursday's night.

- What are your initial impressions of Java?
It is pretty similar to C++.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
Python is more straightforward.
Up to now, I feel that java needs to remember more default steps.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I set the program to not mirror the punctuations when Am or Are is in the front of the sentence. However, I feel it really hard to deal with the 'Do I/you ...?' situation.
